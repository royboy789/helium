# Helium - A WordPress Experiment
A place to talk about WordPress, what you want to see changed. The name `Helium` may be changed in the near future.
  
On June 16th, [JJJ](https://twitter.com/JJJ) and [royboy789](https://twitter.com/royboy789) hosted a hangout session talking about bring back BackPress, as a new inner core library for WordPress removing or modularizing WordPress.  
Some questions need to be answered.

If you want to chat on Slack DM [MattC](https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc) from __AdvancedWP__  - we are keeping the slack channel for those who want to participate in core conversation and contribute code.

## Why
Why do we need to build out a new experimental project for WordPress?  
Are there obstacles in really creating applications with WordPress currently?  
Can those obstacles already be solved by contributing back to core as feature plugins?  
If so, what is stopping someone from creating those plugins?
  
The main goal is to see if there is enough __need__ for BackPress to live again, or whatever it may be called. If we see a significant amount of issues brought up that cannot be fixed with feature plugins, or plugins that likely won't make it into core, then maybe it is worth diving further into the rabbit hole.

## How
__IF__ we decide to support a new experimental project, would it be a continuation of BackPress, a re-write, or a new project all together. Would it start from WordPress as it is today, or would it start from scratch?
  
## Fundamental / Design Differences
### Backwards Compatibility
Some issues cannot be created as feature plugins because of strict guidelines to stay backwards compatible. __IF__ an experimental project were to be born, it would have to decide from the get go, if it will be backwards compatible to WordPress standards.
### Design Pattern
Something else to consider is the design pattern, would the new experiment be MVC or [ADR](http://carlalexander.ca/thoughts-wordpress-and-mvc-pattern/), or should it keep the same design pattern as the current WordPress. How does that decision effect the backwards compatibility?

## How to help
This is an open, empty repo. Create [issues](https://github.com/royboy789/the-wp-experiment/issues) describing in detail obstacles, challenges, and problems you see with WordPress. We will discuss these issues and see if there is any reason to create this experimental project, or maybe we start a collaboration of feature plugins 

# SUPPORT WORDPRESS 
If ever there is a debate where to spend your time, make sure to put some of it back to WordPress core. Get on Slack, find a trac ticket, and submit a patch.
